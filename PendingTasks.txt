To install the Polygon.io Python client and set up your API key, follow these step-by-step instructions. The official client is now called "massive" (after Polygon rebranded to Massive.com in late 2025), but it still works with your existing Polygon API key.
1. Sign Up and Get Your API Key

Go to https://polygon.io (or https://massive.com — same dashboard).
Sign up for a free or paid account.
Log in and go to your dashboard: https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys.
Copy your API key (it looks like AK_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).

2. Install the Python Client
In your project virtual environment (recommended):
Bashpip install -U massive
(or if you prefer the old name, polygon still works but is deprecated):
Bashpip install -U polygon
3. Set Up the API Key (Recommended: Environment Variable)
Never hardcode your API key in code (security risk).
Create a .env file in your project root:
envPOLYGON_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Replace with your actual key
Add .env to .gitignore so it's not committed.
In your Python code (e.g., in main.py or a data fetcher):
Pythonimport os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from massive import RESTClient  # Or 'polygon' if using old package

load_dotenv()  # Loads .env file

api_key = os.getenv("POLYGON_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API key not found in .env")

client = RESTClient(api_key)

# Example: Get last trade for MSFT
trade = client.get_last_trade("MSFT")
print(trade)
4. Test It
Run a simple script:
Python# test_polygon.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from massive import RESTClient

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("POLYGON_API_KEY")

client = RESTClient(api_key)
print(client.get_last_trade("MSFT"))
Bashpython test_polygon.py
You should see real-time trade data.
