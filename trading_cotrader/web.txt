  New: web/approval_api.py

  - FastAPI app factory that takes a WorkflowEngine reference
  - Endpoints: /api/pending, /api/status, /api/approve/{id}, /api/reject/{id}, /api/defer/{id}, /api/history, /api/halt, /api/resume, /api/portfolios
  - Same handle_user_intent() code path as CLI — no new abstractions

  New: ui/approval-dashboard.html

  - Self-contained dark theme (JetBrains Mono, #0a0a0a background — matches existing UI)
  - Status bar: workflow state, cycle, VIX, open trades, pending recs
  - Pending table with type badges, confidence bars, approve/reject/defer buttons
  - Approve modal: portfolio dropdown + notes. Reject modal: reason field
  - Halt banner with resume button. Toast notifications. 15-second auto-refresh.

  Modified: runners/run_workflow.py

  - --web flag starts FastAPI in a daemon thread alongside the CLI
  - --port defaults to 8080
  - Both interfaces work simultaneously (CLI + web)
  - For --once --web, the process stays alive after the cycle so you can browse results

  Modified: runners/run_grid_server.py

  - Deprecation stub pointing to --web flag

  Chicago + Hyderabad access

  Since you're on different networks, you'll need to expose the port. Options:

  # ngrok (quickest)
  ngrok http 8080

  # Or Tailscale (persistent, encrypted)
  # Or Cloudflare Tunnel


  Usage

  python -m trading_cotrader.runners.run_workflow --paper --no-broker --web --port 8080


  Then open http://localhost:8080 — both you and your wife can approve/reject from any browser.


## watchlist

   Here are the TastyTrade watchlists you need to create:                                                                                                       
  
  Watchlist 1: "CoTrader Core" (Main universe — covers all templates)                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                 SPY, QQQ, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA, AMD                                                                                                     
  Used by: correction_premium_sell, ma_crossover_rsi, bollinger_bounce, high_iv_iron_condor                                                                    

  Watchlist 2: "CoTrader Index" (Index/ETF only — for vol arbitrage + hedging)

  SPY, QQQ, SPX, IWM
  Used by: vol_arbitrage_calendar, black_swan_hedge

  Watchlist 3: "CoTrader Earnings" (Dynamic — update weekly based on earnings calendar)

  (Rotates based on upcoming earnings — check yfinance earnings calendar)
  Typical names: AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA, AMD, NFLX, CRM, COST, JPM, BAC
  Used by: earnings_iv_crush

  Or simpler — 1 combined watchlist "CoTrader All":

  SPY, QQQ, SPX, IWM, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA, AMD

  This covers all 7 research templates. The earnings template dynamically pulls from yfinance calendar, but having these names in your watchlist ensures       
  TastyTrade has the data ready.

  Why it matters: When the workflow engine runs with a live broker, the MarketDataAgent and PortfolioStateAgent need positions/watchlist data from TastyTrade. 
  Having these watchlists ensures DXLink streaming can subscribe to quotes and Greeks for all research universe symbols.
