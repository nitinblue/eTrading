Short Put LEAPS

6 to 12 months duration
min 20% ROI
30 to 50 Delta
Ensure stock is above long term support zone
RSI under 30

NVDA current - 191
Jan 15 2027
190 Strike has , you get 3000 credit.. downside protection of 16% (160)
put credit in treasury bill

play around 200 strike and check details..

Once you do this trade, you dont have to do much.. Except if you are in profit m
much earlier, then book the profit and move on to the next trade

Profit is ~ 20%

Ravish generraly does not do cash secrured (naked) you need 16K

If you use marging - margin is 3.7 k..
In this case you will make 81%..

Naked put using marging.. You need more downside risk.

So reduce the strike price, go with 160 , 25 delta..
You get half the credit, but margin is also half.. downside
breakeven is 25%

after a year, lets say stock goes below 25% of safety, then 
you can consider buying the share at that point

But what do you do in case of market crash..

You go with 100 strik, small delta.. but there is no credit.. So keep delta
at least above 20

Take profit 20 to 40%.

check CRWV trade .. 

Look for trade that has taken some beating, but above support zone
their p/e is lower than industry

MEGA WHEEL SYSTEM

idea remains same, make these leap

'''

''' Combine these strategies - Zero Risk Collar Stategy

Buy 100 shares
Buy a put for protection
- choose stricke depending on how much protection you want
- Sell an OTM covered call to collect premium equivalent to put.
- Your upside is capped and downside is prtected.

This will work with longer duration - 12 months set and forget

MU example current 414

Long 100 Shares MU 414
Buy 410 Put

SEll call to that gives equivalent to premium for above..
This uses Put call partiy.

Will work best where call gives more premium..

lets say you can take 10% risk, you can buy put for 370 strike

Mental map

Buy long stock
Buy put .
sell call .

Make breakeven 

look for call to put parity, to maximize.. Write python code
to keep scanning.. these days puts are expensive, so not that much opportunity

. HYBRID COLLAR

BUY 100 SHARE
BUY A PUT FOR PROTECTION
- CHOOSE STRIKE DEPENDING ON THE PROTECTION YOU NEED
- SELL A CALL

---- aDDITIONAL LEG.. SELL DEEP OUT OF MONEY PUT ONE MORE mu 300..

SO NOW YOU MOVE SOLD CALL TO FARTHER RIGHT.. TO COME BREAKEVEN AS CLOSE TO CURRENT
PRICE

all these STRATEGIES YOU HAVE TO DO ON INDIVIDUAL TOP STOCKS 
NOT WITH INDEX LIKE SNP

COLLARS ARE BASICALLY RISK ADJUSTED STRATEGY.. PROFIT ARE CAPPED,
LOSS ARE CAPPED..
