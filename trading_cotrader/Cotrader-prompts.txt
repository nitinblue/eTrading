we both agree that the tech infrastructure is looking decent, lets build upon it.

Change in approach, please see if this is full guidance for you to carry this in much more autonomous way.

Tech focused
1.Build the directory structure and files (in some cases simply without implementation, but correct input and output types for function). If full implementation can be done then it should be without asking for the next steps
1a. consider having more folders in services for risk modules, pricing modules, market data modules, so on and so forth.
2. To complete the tech implementation we will not talk in terms of weeks, rather as a priority it should be done
3. I acknowledge engaging with the system, starting to use it in a very manual way cannot be avoided. but making system intelligent and reliable will take most of the time (i am ok to have a week by week plan for this)
4. Which means you will have to write a lot of code that evaluates the performance or system generated recommendations, and produce stats.. 
5. This brings us to point do we have deep learning or reinforcement learning in place. If we dont we need it.
6. Few points on UI - not that i want to prioritize this now, but i want to prioritize a proof of concept that meets following goals
6a. UI should be a grid, excel/google sheet like... 
6b. UI should be able to hold the objects rather than just mutable values. This is to support our foundational functional programming, dag constructs. 
6c. UI should be a workspace for trader rather that fixed widgets, interactivity should be there

Capability, functionalities, lets go with your categories you had identified, i will capture some sub bullet points

Pre-Trade Risk Management (CRITICAL)
What if that we create should be an object in the UI. SO that parameters can be changed to calculate or get fresh price and mkt data
Position Management (CRITICAL)
Market Regime Detection (HIGH PRIORITY)
Trade Recommendation Engine (HIGH PRIORITY)
Advanced Option Analytics (MEDIUM)
Performance Analytics (MEDIUM)

Critical Gap Analysis:
What's MISSING for Real Money Deployment:

Pre-Trade Risk Management (CRITICAL)

❌ Portfolio-level risk assessment
❌ Correlation analysis (don't put all eggs in correlated baskets)
❌ Max loss scenarios (what if everything goes wrong)
❌ Margin requirement calculations
✓ Basic position size checks (you have this)


Position Management (CRITICAL)

❌ When to adjust a position
❌ When to roll vs. close
❌ Profit-taking rules
❌ Stop-loss triggers
❌ Time-based exit rules (e.g., close at 50% profit or 21 DTE)


Market Regime Detection (HIGH PRIORITY)

❌ VIX regime (low/medium/high)
❌ Trend detection (bull/bear/sideways)
❌ IV rank/percentile tracking
❌ Earnings calendar awareness
❌ Economic event calendar


Trade Recommendation Engine (HIGH PRIORITY)

❌ What to trade today
❌ Best underlyings by IV rank
❌ Optimal strikes/expiration
❌ Expected value calculations
❌ Win rate vs. current portfolio


Advanced Option Analytics (MEDIUM)

✓ Greeks calculation (you have this)
❌ Probability of profit
❌ Greeks-based P&L attribution
❌ Implied move calculations
❌ Volatility smile analysis


Performance Analytics (MEDIUM)

❌ Win rate by strategy
❌ Expectancy (avg win vs. avg loss)
❌ Sharpe ratio
❌ Max drawdown tracking
❌ Trade review system
